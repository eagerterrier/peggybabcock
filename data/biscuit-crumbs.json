    "body": "<p>At the end of a hard shift in Peggy's factories, the workers like nothing more than playing a good old fashioned game of football with our biscuit tins, but this left us with a problem: what to do with all the broken biscuits?</p><p>Our finance department calculated we were wasting around 15 metric tons of biscuits per year, but we didn't want to spoil our sporty scamps' fun.</p><p>Our Biscuit Crumbs are just our usual biscuits but smaller! They come lovingly kicked into crumby goodness for all the family to enjoy.</p>"
